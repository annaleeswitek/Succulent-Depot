# Succulent Supply

ðŸŒµ An eCommerce hub for all your succulent needs! ðŸŒµProject complete! This project was built by Annalee Switek. 

To demo, visit the deployed link: https://succulent-supply.herokuapp.com/

While demo-ing, you can: 

1. Add a succulent to your cart
2. Click a succulent to view it's description and reviews
3. Visit your cart and change the quantity of items
4. Close your browser, re-open, and see that your cart persists
5. Checkout, and visit a thank you page. Your order has been added to the db! 
6. Review a succulent and see your review posted to the succulents description page. 

Thanks for visiting Succulent Supply! I built this as some light practice with React, Redux, Express, Sequelize, Postgres, styling and local storage.
