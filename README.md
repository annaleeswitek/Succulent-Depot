# Succulent Depot

ðŸŒµ An eCommerce hub for all your succulent needs! ðŸŒµ This version is a reboot of a group project built at Fullstack Academy (original codebase can be found here: https://github.com/team-gala/Chronos). It has been further built out and refactored as a fun side project!

## Setup

* This project is built on an excellent boilerplate codebase maintained by Fullstack Academy: https://github.com/FullstackAcademy/boilermaker
* There is a remote called "boilermaker" that can be used to fetch periodic updates and improvements, using the following commands:
```
git fetch boilermaker
git merge boilermaker/master
```
